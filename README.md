## An Update (January 31, 2021)

I've decided to put this version of SongBirb in the past and move on to the new version of SongBirb. From now on, these releases should be considered **betas** and all of their majors should be deprecated. This is kept for historical purposes ONLY. [New repo here.](https://github.com/wibbuffey/SongBirb)

## Intro

SongBirb was a Discord music bot originally created to play Pokémon music. As the communities the betas were released in evolved, its features did too. Therefore, SongBirb has now become a fully open-source Discord bot!

SongBirb allows you to play music from a text file containing a list of songs. By default it plays Pokémon, but it can be changed. Type b!help for more info.

## Running

First, change the token (`logins.token`) in [`config.js`](config.js) to your bot token. Then, run `npm install` to get the dependencies. Finally, run [`index.js`](index.js) and you'll be all good to go!

To contribute, file an issue or PR. All contributions are _more_ than welcome!
